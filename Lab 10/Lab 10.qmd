## The PDB Database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org) (PDB for short). It is the second oldest database (after GenBank).

What is currently in the PDB? We can access current composition stats [here](https://www.rcsb.org/stats)

```{r}
stats <- read.csv (file = "Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(stats)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray

# Substitute comma for nothing
y <- gsub(",", "", x)

# Convert to numeric
sum(as.numeric(y))
```

Turn this snippet into a function so I can use it any time I have this comma problem (i.e. the other columns of this 'stats' table)

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x) {
  # Substitute comma for nothing
  y <- gsub(",", "", x)

  # Convert to numeric and sum
  return(sum(as.numeric(y)))

}
```

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$X.ray)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Total)
```

```{r}
xray.sum/total.sum*100
```

```{r}
em.sum/total.sum*100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
protein.sum <- comma.sum(stats[1,7])
total.protein.sum <- comma.sum(stats[,7])
protein.sum/total.protein.sum*100
```


>Q3. Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED

## 2. Visualizing with Mol-star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG` 
Mol-star homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

## 3. Using the bio3d package in R

The Bio3D package is focused on structural bioinformatics analysis and allows us to read and analyze PDB (and related) data.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

We can see atom data with `pdb$atom`:

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdbseq(pdb))
```

We can make quick 3D viz with the `view.pdb()` function.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
library(NGLVieweR)
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)

 # view.pdb(pdb, cols=c("green", "orange"),
  #       highlight = sel,
  #       highlight.style = "spacefill") |>
 # setRock()
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can finish off today with a bioinformatics prediction of the functional motions of a protein.

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
 # view.nma(m)
```

We can write-out a trajectory of the predicted dynamics and view this in Mol-star.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```
