Load up the packages we will need for analysis of protein structure sets. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

We will analyze the ADK starting with a single ADK database accession code: "1ake_A"

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```
Now we can search the PDB database to find all related entries. 
```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
attributes(blast)
```

```{r}
head(blast$hit.tbl)
```

Make a little summary figure of these results:
```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

Our "top hits" i.e. the most similar entries in the database are:

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```
