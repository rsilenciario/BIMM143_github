Today we will take a wee step back to some data we can taste, and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy.

## 1. Data Import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```


> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(candy$fruity)
```
38

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Almond Joy",]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

## 2. Explanatory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given data set. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new data set.

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```
> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all others.

```{r}
apply(candy, 2, sd)
```
> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

It represents whether the candy contains chocolate (1 = TRUE) or if it does not (0 = FALSE).

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, col = "lightblue")
```


> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```
Median is below 50%. 

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate ==1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```
```{r}
fruit.inds <- candy$fruity ==1
fruit.candy <- candy[fruit.inds,]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```

Yes with a P-value of `r ans$p.value` meaning the differences in average win percents are statistically significant.

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here. One is the classic `sort()` and `order()`

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```
> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,], 5)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing=T)
head( candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by winpercent values
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```
Let's add some color now. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(x=winpercent, y=reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent), fill = chocolate) +
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together with whether it is a bar or not. 

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width = 3, height = 10)
```
To insert an image with a preferred size: 
![My silly barplot image](mybarplot.png)

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Charleston Chew

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starbust

## 3. Winpercent vs Pricepercent
```{r}
# Pink and gray are too light, lets change to red and black
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"

library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=mycols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 9)
```
> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Top 5 most expensive candy types:
```{r}
inds <- order(candy$price)
tail(candy[inds,], 5)
```
Least popular candy: 
```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 1)
```

## 4. Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are negatively correlated

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and win percent

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate", "winpercent"], 2)
```


## 5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the data set.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot" 

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x))+
  geom_point(col=mycols)+
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps=6, col=mycols)+
  theme_bw()
```
The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot. 

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation))+
  geom_col()
```
```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill = PC1)+
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Pluribus, hard, and fruity.
